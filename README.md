1.	Sunless Sea is a survival and exploration game set in a dark, Lovecraftian world. The game relies on good writing to create a sense of dread and unease, with the player exploring the mysterious underground ocean and encountering strange and dangerous creatures. The writing is rich and immersive, creating a world that feels alive and terrifying. Of course, Sunless Sea has several other gameplay pillars, but it is the stories told through text alone that end up being the best part of the experience.
